    "Within the framework this project, we tried to understand whether the company should implement a new page or keep the old page with following:\n",
    "- Probability based approach\n",
    "- A/B test\n",
    "- Regression approach\n",
    "\n",
    "**Probability based approach:**\n",
    "  - We found that probability of an individual receiving the new page is 0.5001\n",
    "  - Meaning, there is almost the same chance that an individual received the old page\n",
    "\n",
    "**A/B test:**\n",
    "  - In A/B test we set up our hypothesis to test if new page results in better conversion or not\n",
    "  - We simulated our user groups with respect to conversions\n",
    "  - We found the p_value to be 0.8879\n",
    "  - With such a p-value, we failed to reject null hypothesis\n",
    "  - By using the built-in `stats.proportions_ztest` we computed z-score and p-value which confirmed our earlier p-value and failure to reject null hypothesis\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Regression Approach:**\n",
    "  - We looked at exploring two possible outcomes. Whether new page is better or not.\n",
    "  - With logistic regression results, we again encountered same z-score as well as p-value of 0.190, corresponding two-tailed case\n",
    "  - By further adding geographic location of the users, we tried to find if any specific country had an impact on conversion\n",
    "  - The result gave a similar outlook and suggested that the countries have no impact on the conversion rate.\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Consideration:**\n",
    "  - We also looked at the duration of the experiment (21 days). \n",
    "  - This is a relatively short period of time to run the A/B test.\n",
    "  - Due to Change aversion effect, a group of users may give an unfair advantage to the older page\n",
    "  - Similarly, due to Novelty effect, users may give an unfair advantage to the newer page"
